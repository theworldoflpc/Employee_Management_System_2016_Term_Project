Employee Management System Term Project in C#. 

Employee_Management_System_2016_Term_Project
in collaboration with fellow students: RSkowron, DPitters, CWilson. 
# FIRST VERSION : 2016-11-17
I was the Project Manager of this term long project. This repo contains the C# source code 
for a console based user interface menu for an Employee Management System. 
It is designed in a hierarchical style and contains several submenus that the user of the 
program is able to navigate through. The user is able to update, delete, search and add 
employees through this menu console.  All data is logged to a flatfile. 
This repo contains a Doxygen file which further explains project.
